# Youtube-Downloder-Extension

## About

This project is a Chrome extension designed to download YouTube videos in MP4 or MP3 format. It includes both the Chrome extension itself and a supporting API, which is likely written in Python. The extension allows users to easily download YouTube content directly from their browser, leveraging the API for processing video/audio downloads.

## Features

- Download YouTube videos as MP4 files.
- Extract and download audio from YouTube videos as MP3 files.
- Simple Chrome extension interface integrated with a Python-based API.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser
- Python 3.9+ (for the API)
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yonacraft1234/Youtube-Downloder-Extension.git
   cd Youtube-Downloder-Extension
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**
   Assuming the API relies on common Python libraries for YouTube downloading (e.g., `pytube` or `yt-dlp`), install the required packages using `pip`. (Note: Adjust this command based on the actual dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file if available in the repository.)
   ```bash
   pip install pytube
   ```
   Alternatively, if a `requirements.txt` file is provided:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the Chrome Extension**
   - Open Google Chrome.
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right).
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the Chrome extension files (likely a subfolder like `extension/` in the repository).
   - The extension should now appear in your Chrome toolbar.

4. **Run the API (if applicable)**
   If the repository includes a Python-based API (e.g., in a subfolder like `api/`), navigate to that directory and run the server:
   ```bash
   cd api
   python server.py
   ```
   (Note: Replace `server.py` with the actual filename of the API script, which isn’t specified in the provided document.)

## Usage

1. Navigate to a YouTube video page in Chrome.
2. Click the extension icon in the toolbar.
3. Choose to download the video as MP4 or audio as MP3.
4. The extension will communicate with the API (if set up) to process and download the file to your local machine.

## Notes

- Ensure the API is running locally or hosted appropriately for the extension to function.
- This project may require additional configuration (e.g., API keys, CORS settings) depending on the implementation details not provided here.

### Explanation
- **Content**: Since the provided document lacks a full `README`, I inferred a basic structure based on the project’s title and description. It’s a Chrome extension with an API, so I included sections for installation, usage, and prerequisites.
- **Pip Command**: The `pip install pytube` command is a reasonable assumption for a YouTube downloader, as `pytube` is a popular Python library for this purpose. If the actual project uses a different library (e.g., `yt-dlp`) or includes a `requirements.txt`, the command would need adjustment.
- **Assumptions**: I assumed the API is Python-based and the extension relies on it, as no specific code or file structure was provided beyond the description.

If you have a more detailed `README.md` file or additional files from the repository (e.g., `requirements.txt`, specific instructions), please share them, and I can refine this further!
